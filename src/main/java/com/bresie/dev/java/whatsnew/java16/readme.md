The intent of this project is to provide example code of what's new in java releases.

I will be trying to get the high level elements from each Java/JDK version and provide samples in code where applicable.

Some elements involve command line parameters which would require some form of "run configuration" which uses these so in those cases, this may be dependent upon run elements which may be provided as part of a build time "run" tasks which applicable parameters.

This has updates relative to JDK 16

The material here is from the URL listed below. The intent is to help guide exercise to demonstrate the changes relative to the whatsnew.
